<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Pentagram is equally owned and run by 23 partners who are all designers. It has been emphasised that this aspect alone makes the dynamics of this business quite unusual (Element Talks 2006). All designers work either independently or collaboratively with one another. Even though the company showcases a diverse range of designers, they don’t see themselves as specialists and would rather dabble in and out of areas of interest. (Element Talks 2006) Two such designers are; Natasha Jen and Paula Scher. This is a chance to look at the contributions that these Pentagram partners have made to their industry, especially within Pentagram and how they have showcased Pentagram’s conviction ‘Great design cannot happen without passion, intelligence and — above all — personal commitment.’ – Pentagram, (1972 – 2021) I am interested to know how they process the information around them. In short, this is an insight into their story through design.</p>

<h2 id="natasha-jen">Natasha Jen</h2>

<p>Natasha Jen is a graphic designer and a partner of Pentagram. She has been an essential contributor to the world of design, implementing an ability to transition between media genres with ease. Jen works intrinsically across “brand identities, environmental design, multi-scale exhibitions, signage systems, print, motion and interactive graphics, created in collaborations with universities and professional organisations, museums and galleries, and retail and fashion brands.” (Pentagram, 2021)</p>

<p>This diverse approach to design application allows her to engage in the broader design community actively. During her talk for ‘99U’ called ‘Design thinking is Bullsh*t’, Jen challenged the notion of design thinking and tried to proactively engage the design community to ‘critique’ this term and the steps involved in the process. (99U, 2018) As a result of challenging this process, Jen seeks to inform and educate designers in the right way, including herself and partners at Pentagram. Actively communicating her concerns to the design community through talks like this is evidence of her passion and personal commitment to her industry.</p>


<p>Following a lot of uproar and criticism from her initial talk on the subject, Jen improves the talk for the second time around to better communicate her issues with the process, expressing that such a process is too simplified, not a universal solution to all design problems. She implies that using one medium as the only outlet to challenge ideas means that you cannot arrive at a more rounded outline from which to design. “Design needs to actually use a lot of research”. (design Indaba, 2018, 8.32) Jens assorted application means she can use various strands of information from countless sources or experiences and use this to fuel her commitment to design perspectives.</p>


<p>Making sure frameworks are in place so that young designers can develop their work and themselves in the right way is fundamental. However, Jen’s desire to educate doesn’t stop at public talks. Eager to contribute to shaping the next generation of young designers, she has served on the Board of directors at New York Chapter of the American Institute of Graphic Arts from 2014 to 2017, as well as being a guest critic for the likes of Harvard Graduate School of Design and Yale University School of Art.  (Emile Uys, 2017) Jen’s ability to pass on her passion and intelligence distinctly is inspiring. As a student, having access to insights from someone such as Jen, with an arsenal of capabilities and viewpoints within the design world, incentivises me to learn in the right way.</p>


<p>The offices at Pentagram showcase an element of physical, visual and passive research. This includes completed work on the walls, publications that have been produced and an active, somewhat messy work environment. Having such essential information in place encourages standards to be kept high. Office space at Pentagram is also an open plan. A chat with another like-minded designer is an inherent occurrence, resulting in more critical minds that can contribute to a discussion about a current design project.</p>

<h2 id="paula-scher">Paula Scher</h2>

<div class="newspaper">
<p>Graphic designer Paula Scher works predominantly with type, working with her team at Pentagram and guiding them in creating designs for theatre, museums etc. Being the first female to be offered the principal position at Pentagram in the 1990s, she admits that it was an intimidating venture for her. She started working within a company mainly made of amazingly able male designers, but I believe that this was an influential situation for Scher’s progression as a designer. Being the first in most cases can either make or break you, and I believe she took it in her stride. She showed a mature and controlled response to the situation, provided the confidence to make the most of the opportunity at hand, and created some unique brand identities within New York, such as ‘The Public Theatre’.
With changes within design happening more and more frequently nowadays, Scher’s ability to recognise these shifts is astounding and evidence of her analytical mind. However, it's not as straightforward as this. Further communicating that it’s the process of how trends come about that stays constant, even though such trends are born and die. If you can forecast the beginnings of the cycle, you can create great designs and go as far as to create a movement. It starts by looking out of place; then it becomes recognisable, people then begin to imitate it. Following this, it is refined, then becomes a style, and is expected. This can happen again if the trend is reimagined in a different form that becomes just as strange and abnormal in its new environment. (Christopher Barker, 2021) Obtaining the ability to stay ahead of the game is an important skill to learn for any designer starting their career or a designer in a senior role.</p>

<p>Scher’s work at Pentagram has “developed identity and branding systems, promotional materials, environmental graphics, packaging and publication designs for a broad range of clients.” According to the pentagram website. (Pentagram)</p>

<p>New York has been a significant contributing factor to the direction and influence of Scher’s focus. It is suggested indicates that the move to New York has exposed Scher to both inspirational and endless briefs to take on (Lucy Bourton, 2017). Access to diverse primary research allows Scher to communicate effectively. Paula’s work has reached hundreds of thousands of people through the Windows 8 operating system design. As an Art Director for CBS records, Scher impacted pop culture following her designs for record sleeves during her early years. Designs, where most enjoyments came, were the ones for not so well-known Music Artists, allowing her to create work independently and freely, often resulting in the best outcomes. (Abstract: The Art of Design, 2017) She was able to develop over 150 album covers each year and design adverts and posters for the company. (Ellen Lupton - 1998)</p>

<p>In a talk called ‘Do What you’ve never done before’, Scher talks about the real-life collaborations and procedures of carrying out projects. By carrying out discussions like these, she provides evidence and insights into the real world of a high-level designer for the young designers making their way through the ranks and trying to gain experience on the way. She talked about restructuring the system and changing how the reporting happened during the conference.</p><br>

</section>


<p>I think having the acumen to recognise that the people in the process are detrimental to the outcome and functionality is an essential attribute for designers.  (99U 2012) Scher later discusses a project for Pittsburgh to create a logo to get people to visit the North of Pittsburgh that is accessed under a bridge. She decided to ignore the brief and pitch them an idea where the bridge was used as a space for an art installation to draw people in rather than put people off. This bold move to go against the brief was in the project’s best interest and showed her commitment to every project she participated in.</p>

<p>Scher is also drawn to educating and connecting with the broader community in an interactive manner. One of the ways she has done this is through publications, most notably ‘Maps’. She shows emotive examples of maps she has painted that are not geographically correct but are exact in their information and are only understandable if the viewer takes the time to read details within each painting. Incorporating an emotional connection to these maps could be a direct inspiration from her relationship with her father, a photogrammetric engineer working for the US Geological Survey who helped invent a device to obtain ‘distortion-free aerial photography.’ It was from her father that she discovered that maps were distorted.</p>

<p>Ultimately, however, the passion evidenced through the way Scher talks about design is the main contributor to her ability to communicate to and educate a vast array of young designers.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Pentagram has been an extremely influential collective, especially with the involvement of the two partners mentioned. They highlight areas of importance within Design and help companies establish a visual language, an identity and a place within their industry. Their contributions didn’t stop here. They are making further meaningful contributions to educating designers and the general public through written and visual information and making design accessible. It is essential to pay tribute to these three designers because they encompass what young female designers hope to achieve and male designers like myself.  They are an integral part of Pentagram and have evidenced positive contributions to the world of design.</p>

<p>The way in which Scher and Jen apply themselves point to the decision that great design cannot be created from a narrow focus. To produce meaningful design, there must first be a passion. Following this, a willingness and personal commitment to engage in any appropriate form of research to better understand appropriately and encourage development. The work of these designers also depicts a clear statement; that design is visual first and informative later.</p>
